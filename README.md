## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

- Uses Twitter‚Äôs internal GraphQL API:

```
/i/api/graphql/VaenaVgh5q5ih7kvyVjgtg/DeleteTweet
```

 Uses your current session cookies (`ct0`, OAuth token) to authenticate
- Deletes in batches (5 at a time with 1.5s delay) to avoid rate-limiting

---

## üîê Privacy & Security

- All operations happen **locally in your browser**
- Your archive file is never uploaded or sent anywhere
- Your login/session is used *only* to authenticate against Twitter while you're actively logged in
